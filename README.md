# Deployment-Pipelines-and-Cloud-Platforms
Introduction to leveraging github actions to automate deployment processes

Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipelines

Objectives:

- Define and understand the stages of a deployment pipeline.
- ﻿﻿Learn about different deployment strategies.

Lesson Details:

1. Defining Deployment Stages:
   
- ﻿﻿Development: Writing and testing code in a local environment.
- ﻿﻿Integration: Merging code changes to a shared branch.
- ﻿﻿Testing: Running automated tests to ensure code quality.
- ﻿﻿Staging: Deploying code to a production-like environment for final testing.
- ﻿﻿Production: Releasing the final version of your code to the end-users.
  
2. Understanding Deployment Strategies:
   
- ﻿﻿Blue-Green Deployment: Running two production environments, only one of which serves end-users at any time.
- Canary Releases: Rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.
- Rolling Deployment: Gradually replacing instances of the previous version of an application with the new version.

Lesson 2: Automated Releases and Versioning


Objectives:
- ﻿﻿Automate versioning in the CI/ CD process.
- ﻿﻿Create and manage software releases.

Automating Versioning in Cl/CD:

1. Semantic Versioning:

- ﻿﻿Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for your software. It uses a three-part version number, for example, 'MAJOR MINOR. PATCH* .
- ﻿﻿Resource: Semantic Versioning.

2. Automated Versioning with GitHub Actions:
   
- Implement automated versioning using GitHub Actions to increment version numbers automatically based on code changes.
Example snippet for a versioning script in GitHub Actions:

```
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # The checkout action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
        # This action automatically increments the patch version and tags the commit.
        # 'DEFAULT_BUMP' specifies the type of version bump (major, minor, patch).

```
- This action will automatically increment the patch version and create a new tag each time changes are pushed to the main branch.


Creating and Managing Releases:

1. Automating Releases with GitHub Actions:
   
- Set up GitHub Actions to create a new release whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.
Example snippet to create a release:

```
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Checks out the code in the tag that triggered the workflow.

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{" github.ref "}}
          release_name: Release ${{" github.ref "}}
          # This step creates a new release in GitHub using the tag name.

```
- The 'actions/create-release@vl' action is used to create a release on GitHub. It uses the tag that triggered the workflow to name and label the release.


Troubleshooting and Additional Resources:
- ﻿﻿For troubleshooting GitHub Actions, the GitHub Actions Documentation is an invaluable resource.
- ﻿﻿To resolve issues related to specific actions used in your workflow, refer to their respective repositories on GitHub or their documentation.
- For general questions and community support, the GitHub Community Forum can be a great place to seek help.
- ﻿﻿Remember, reading through the logs generated by GitHub Actions can provide insights into what might be going wrong with your workflows.


Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms

Objectives:
- ﻿Deploy applications to popular cloud platforms using GitHub Actions.
- Configure deployment environments.

Lesson Details:
Detailed Guide: Deploying Applications to Cloud Platforms with GitHub Actions
Here's a detailed breakdown of deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform using GitHub Actions:

Step 1: Choose a Cloud Platform
- ﻿﻿Decide on a cloud platform based on your project requirements. Each platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) has its own set of services and pricing models.
- AWS: Amazon Web Services
- ﻿﻿Azure: Microsoft Azure
- ﻿﻿Google Cloud Platform: GCP


2. Defining the Workflow:
• A workflow is defined with a series of steps that run on specified events.
Example for AWS Deployment:


```
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # This workflow triggers on a push to the 'main' branch.

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Specifies the runner environment.

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

    - name: Set up AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{" secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "}}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{" secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "}}
        aws-region: us-west-2
      # Configures AWS credentials from GitHub secrets.

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        # Add your deployment script here.
        # For example, using AWS CLI commands to deploy.
```

- This workflow deploys your application to AWS when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Step 3: Configuring Deployment Environments

1. Setting Up Environment Variables and Secrets:
   
- ﻿﻿Store sensitive information like API keys and access tokens as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
- ﻿﻿Use environment variables for non-sensitive configuration.
  
2. Environment-Specific Workflow:
   
- Tailor your workflow for different environments (development, staging, production) by using conditions or different workflow files.

  
Additional Resources:

-  ﻿﻿GitHub Actions Documentation: For a comprehensive understanding, refer to the official [documentation.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- ﻿﻿AWS GitHub Actions: Learn more about the [AWS actions]((https://github.com/aws-actions)) available on GitHub.
- ﻿﻿Azure GitHub Actions: Check out [Azure actions.](https://github.com/Azure/actions)
- ﻿﻿Google Cloud GitHub Actions: Explore [Google Cloud actions.](https://github.com/google-github-actions)

  
Troubleshooting:

- Review action logs in GitHub for errors during execution.
